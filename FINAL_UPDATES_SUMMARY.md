**Date:** December 2024

## Overview

The research paper has been successfully updated with all requested modifications, resulting in a comprehensive 19-page academic document that addresses the specific requirements for enhanced literature review, updated reward system, and streamlined content structure.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Visualization System Architecture Section (4.3)**

#### **What Was Removed:**
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Detailed explanation of data formats and processing workflow
- **Chart Generation Process**: Step-by-step breakdown of visualization creation
- **Technical Implementation Details**: Specific code function documentation
- **HTML Report Integration**: Responsive design and data integration details

#### **Impact:**
- **Streamlined Content**: Removed redundant technical details that were covered elsewhere
- **Improved Flow**: Better focus on core methodology and results
- **Reduced Length**: Paper now 19 pages (down from 20 pages)
- **Cleaner Structure**: More focused on essential research contributions

### 2. **Enhanced Literature Review with Proper Author Names**

#### **Updated Citations:**
- **Li et al. (2017)**: Deep reinforcement learning for trading
- **Jiang et al. (2017)**: Deep reinforcement learning framework for portfolio management
- **Chen et al. (2014)**: Wisdom of crowds and social media sentiment
- **Li (2015)**: Information content of forward-looking statements
- **Hutto and Gilbert (2014)**: VADER sentiment analysis tool

#### **Improvements:**
- **Professional Citations**: Proper author names instead of question marks
- **Academic Credibility**: Enhanced scholarly presentation
- **Complete References**: Full bibliographic information provided
- **LaTeX Compatibility**: Fixed ampersand character issues

### 3. **Enhanced Reward System with Weighted Risk and Sentiment**

#### **New Multi-Factor Reward Function:**
```
R_t = α·r_t + β·s_t - γ·σ_t
```

Where:
- **r_t**: Asset return at time t
- **s_t**: Sentiment score
- **σ_t**: Risk measure (volatility)
- **α, β, γ**: Weighting parameters (1.0, 0.3, 0.2)

#### **Key Features:**
- **Return Maximization**: Primary focus on asset returns (α = 1.0)
- **Sentiment Integration**: Positive sentiment weighting (β = 0.3)
- **Risk Penalty**: Volatility penalty to encourage risk-aware decisions (γ = 0.2)
- **Balanced Approach**: Multi-factor consideration for optimal decision-making

#### **Implementation Updates:**
- **Environment Code**: Updated `src/agent/env.py` with new reward calculation
- **Mathematical Formulation**: Added equation and detailed explanation
- **Parameter Specification**: Clear weighting scheme documentation
- **Theoretical Justification**: Comprehensive explanation of multi-factor approach

## Technical Implementation Details

### **Reward System Implementation:**

```python
# Multi-factor reward: R_t = α·r_t + β·s_t - γ·σ_t
alpha, beta, gamma = 1.0, 0.3, 0.2  # Weighting parameters
reward = alpha * basic_return + beta * sentiment_score - gamma * risk_measure
```

### **Key Benefits:**
1. **Risk-Aware Learning**: Agent learns to balance returns with risk
2. **Sentiment Integration**: Incorporates market sentiment into decision-making
3. **Adaptive Behavior**: Can adjust strategy based on multiple factors
4. **Realistic Trading**: More closely mimics real-world investment considerations
